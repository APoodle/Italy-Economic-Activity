# <div align='center'>An Analysis Of The Italian Economy</div>

### Overview
This is an analysis of the effect of monetary policy on the Italian Economy. This is much more of an analysis than anything else. While I did use R to obtain all of my insights and visualizations, there is not necessarily anything complex in the code. What is complex is the statistics used. Vector autoregression, autocorrelation functions, and orthogonal response functions are used in this analysis.

The contents of the repository include:
- Economic-Activity-of-Italy.png, which is the banner image used in this readme
- Italy Data.zip, which is all the data used in this analysis
- Monetary Policy and Economic Activity of Italy.pdf, which is the report

### Prerequisites
To fully understand this analysis, I recommend:
- A basic understanding of R
- A solid understanding of statistics
